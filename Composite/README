The Composite Pattern allows us to build structures of objects in the form of trees that contains both composition of objects and individual objects as nodes. Using a composite structure, we can apply the same operations over both composites and individual objects. In other words, in most cases we can ignore the differences between compositions of objects and individual objects.
The Composite Pattern has four participants:
• Component 
• Leaf
• Composite 
• Client
-->When to use Composite Pattern
• When you want to represent part-whole hierarchies of objects.
• When you want clients to be able to ignore the difference between compositions of objects and individual objects. Clients will treat all objects in the composite structure uniformly.
