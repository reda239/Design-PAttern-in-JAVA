-->Use of Bridge Pattern
You should use the Bridge Pattern when:
• You want to avoid a permanent binding between an abstraction and its implementation. This might be the case, for example, when the implementation must be selected or switched at run-time.
• Both the abstractions and their implementations should be extensible by sub-classing. In this case, the Bridge pattern lets you combine the different abstractions and implementations and extend them independently.
• Changes in the implementation of an abstraction should have no impact on clients; that is, their code should not have to be recompiled.
